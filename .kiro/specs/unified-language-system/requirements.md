# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to unify the language selection system by merging the separate UI language and content language settings into a single, cohesive language selection option. Currently, users can independently select different languages for the user interface and API content, which creates a confusing user experience and poor system design. The unified system will ensure that when a user selects a language, both the UI and content are consistently presented in that language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select a single language option that controls both the app interface and content language, so that I have a consistent experience throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the language settings THEN the system SHALL display a single "Language" option instead of separate "UI Language" and "Content Language" options
2. WHEN the user selects a language THEN the system SHALL apply that language to both the user interface and API content translation
3. WHEN the user changes the language THEN the system SHALL immediately update both UI strings and translate content from the API
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL use the same language for both UI and content based on the user's previous selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language change to be seamless and immediate, so that I don't have to restart the app or navigate through multiple screens to see the changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a new language THEN the system SHALL immediately update all visible UI elements without requiring app restart
2. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL automatically reload and translate all currently displayed content
3. WHEN navigating between screens after language change THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected language consistently across all screens
4. WHEN the user returns to the app after closing it THEN the system SHALL remember and apply the previously selected language

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the language selection process, so that I understand what's happening when content is being translated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is being translated THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with appropriate messaging
2. WHEN translation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to the original Spanish content
3. WHEN the user selects English THEN the system SHALL show translation progress for API content
4. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL remove loading indicators and display the translated content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and maintainable language management system, so that future language additions are straightforward and the codebase remains organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the unified system THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate language management code
2. WHEN a new language is added THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes to support it
3. WHEN the language changes THEN the system SHALL use a single source of truth for the current language state
4. WHEN managing language state THEN the system SHALL use reactive programming patterns to automatically update dependent components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language selection to be intuitive and follow platform conventions, so that the experience feels native and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing language options THEN the system SHALL display languages with their native names and appropriate flag icons
2. WHEN the current language is displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which language is currently selected
3. WHEN accessing language settings THEN the system SHALL follow Android Material Design guidelines for selection interfaces
4. WHEN no language is explicitly selected THEN the system SHALL default to Spanish (the API's native language)
